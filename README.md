# Highlight Clipper

---

## üëÄ Introduction

- I'm just a starter or a student who just want to make this thing work, everything is made using AI, if something wrong I might not be able to help you.
- This is just an early stage development, so everything won't be working like it would be like clipping via emotion and stuff will come with later update.
- If you are a senior, please help suggesting somewhere I can improve, thank you.
